Hummus is a smooth and creamy puree of cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans), tahini sesame paste and an acid, typically lemon juice. While hummus usually has garlic now, centuries ago it did not.
Olive oil isnâ€™t a requirement either, but most modern recipes list it as an ingredient

<p><em>Egypt</em>  is considered to be the birthplace of the earliest versions, and every variation is part of that family tree. 
The advent of a <strong> robust spice trade spread the high-protein dip</strong> around the globe because it's nexpensive and easy to make. <p> Chocolate hummus is a popular flavor.
If you're curious, <q> try serving it with salty chips, pita, biscuits or fresh fruits.</q></p>
